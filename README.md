Two repos.
Two projects.
Two days.
Two ways of running auth for your Rails project.

### Day one (Wedndesday):

Build two Rails apps with auth -- one with Devise, one without.

### Day two (Thursday):

Add Omniauth to both apps
Omniauth - 3rd party AUTHENTICATION!

### Then Friday will be Rails Project Prep/Office Hours combo
