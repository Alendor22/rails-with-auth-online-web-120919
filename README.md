[second-lecture](https://github.com/howardbdev/rails-with-auth-online-web-120919/tree/second-lecture) - only for Omniauth WITH Devise

[master](https://github.com/howardbdev/rails-with-auth-online-web-120919) - up-to-date with omniauth-with-google-no-devise so if you're using devise make sure to switch branches.

Two repos. <br/>
Two projects. <br/>
Two days. <br/>
Two ways of running auth for your Rails project.<br/>
